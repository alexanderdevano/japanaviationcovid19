The Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the global aviation industry, and Japan's aviation sector is no exception. This analysis aims to analyze the effects of Covid-19 cases in Japan on both international and domestic flights, focusing on airports and airlines. The dataset used for analysis consists of flight data from the Open Sky Network spanning the years 2020 and 2021, comprising more than 50 million lines, as well as Japan’s Covid-19 Cases datasets from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.

The analysis begins by examining the overall trends in flight activities during this period, highlighting the magnitude of the disruption caused by the pandemic. By applying various analytical techniques, including data visualization and statistical modeling, the study explores the relationship between Covid-19 cases and flight patterns, with a focus on major airports, local airports, major carriers, and low-cost airlines.

The findings reveal significant changes in the aviation industry as a result of the pandemic. The analysis uncovers variations in the reduction of international and domestic flights across different airports and airlines in Japan, shedding light on the varying degrees of impact. Additionally, the study examines the temporal patterns of these changes, identifying key periods when the aviation industry experienced the most significant disruptions.

By providing insights into the Covid-19 impact on Japan's aviation industry, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by the sector and informs policymakers, airport authorities, and airlines about the potential strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of future crises. The findings can aid in developing targeted measures for ensuring the resilience and recovery of the aviation industry in the face of similar challenges.
